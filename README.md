# Jalipod

Jalibut is an open-source "search ahead" based directory that can be used to showcase any collection of entities. Try out the demo [here](https://darshandsoni.com/jalibut/).

## Why?

There are podcast repositories that are easy to search but are closed-source and require a login to explore them. Then there are wonderful open-source "awesome lists" curated by authors in various lagoons, trenches and corals of the internet that are rich but not easy to search. Jalipod takes curated podcast lists and allows listeners to easily search through or contribute to them. 

## Contributing

Contribututions can be made by adding entries to the `objects.js` file in JSON format and submitting a pull request. A handy tool to easily format a list of podcasts is the [Jalibut converter](https://darshandsoni.com/jalibut/converter)

## To-Do

- [ ] Add more podcast lists.
- [ ] Separate the "Chinese" category into the specific spoken language used.
- [ ] Improve site aesthetics.
